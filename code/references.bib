	title = {Field Demonstration of the Brick Ontology to Scale up the Deployment of {ASHRAE} Guideline 36 Control Sequences},
	abstract = {Many commercial buildings have a vast network of sensors as part of their building automation systems ({BAS}) that allows opportunities for energy consumption and cost savings by deploying advanced control sequences. However, this resource is often underutilized since {BAS} are typically programmed with simple control sequences with limited potential to deliver on these opportunities. The recent availability of {ASHRAE} Guideline 36 (G36) with advanced {HVAC} control sequences supports control retrofits in existing buildings to unlock much of the savings potential. However, barriers such as the lack of standard naming convention of building assets and data points, proprietary equipment and {BAS}, and the inherent uniqueness of buildings and their systems prevent building stakeholders from adopting any “plug-and-play” implementation of G36. Instead, control vendors must often undertake the manual and labor-intensive point mapping process to identify a data stream’s functional and spatial relationship within the {HVAC} system along with other relevant contexts and map it to the new control sequences. The vendor must carry out the point mapping process in each individual building since the mapping is unlikely to port over to another building. Even for the same building, the point mapping process can occur multiple times if various control vendors implement different control retrofits and/or multiple control retrofits happen over the lifecycle of the building. Then, there is the likelihood that G36 control sequences are programmed uniquely to the building, preventing the same implementation from being reused in another. Therefore, this paper presents a field demonstration of how we leveraged the Brick ontology with {BACnet}, {OpenBuildingControl}’s Control Description Language ({CDL}), and open-source support tools to implement scalable and portable advanced building controls. These tools provide standardized semantic descriptions and relationships of the building’s assets and data points (Brick), standardized communication protocol to read from and write to the building’s {BAS} ({BACnet}), and standardized code implementations ({CDL}) of standardized advanced control strategies (G36). We implemented G36’s hot water supply temperature setpoint reset in a Berkeley, {CA} building for this field demonstration. This field demonstration aims to show how integrating these tools may streamline the deployment of advanced control sequences such as G36 in a consistent manner regardless of differences found across buildings.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.02.023},
	abstract = {The foundations of all methodologies for the measurement and verification (M\&V) of energy savings are based on the same five key principles: accuracy, completeness, conservatism, consistency and transparency. The most widely accepted methodologies tend to generalise M\&V so as to ensure applicability across the spectrum of energy conservation measures ({ECM}'s). These do not provide a rigid calculation procedure to follow. This paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level methodologies and the practical application of modelling algorithms, with a particular focus on the industrial buildings sector. This is achieved with the development of a novel, machine learning supported methodology for M\&V 2.0 which enables accurate and reliable quantification of savings. A novel and computationally efficient feature selection algorithm and powerful machine learning regression algorithms are employed to maximise the effectiveness of available data. The baseline period energy consumption is modelled using artificial neural networks, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbours and multiple ordinary least squares regression. Improved knowledge discovery and an expanded boundary of analysis allow more complex energy systems be analysed, thus increasing the applicability of M\&V. A case study in a large biomedical manufacturing facility is used to demonstrate the methodology's ability to accurately quantify the savings under real-world conditions. The {ECM} was found to result in 604,527{\textbackslash},{kWh} of energy savings with 57\% uncertainty at a confidence interval of 68\%. 20 baseline energy models are developed using an exhaustive approach with the optimal model being used to quantify savings. The range of savings estimated with each model are presented and the acceptability of uncertainty is reviewed. The case study demonstrates the ability of the methodology to perform M\&V to an acceptable standard in challenging circumstances.},

	abstract = {Trustworthy savings calculations are critical to convincing investors in energy efficiency projects of the benefit and cost-effectiveness of such investments and their ability to replace or defer supply-side capital investments. However, today's methods for measurement and verification (M\&amp;V) of energy savings constitute a significant portion of the total costs of efficiency projects. They also require time-consuming manual data acquisition and often do not deliver results until years after the program period has ended. The rising availability of “smart” meters, combined with new analytical approaches to quantifying savings, has opened the door to conducting M\&amp;V more quickly and at lower cost, with comparable or improved accuracy. These meter- and software-based approaches, increasingly referred to as “M\&amp;V 2.0”, are the subject of surging industry interest, particularly in the context of utility energy efficiency programs. Program administrators, evaluators, and regulators are asking how M\&amp;V 2.0 compares with more traditional methods, how proprietary software can be transparently performance tested, how these techniques can be integrated into the next generation of whole-building focused efficiency programs. This paper expands recent analyses of public-domain whole-building M\&amp;V methods, focusing on more novel M\&amp;V 2.0 modeling approaches that are used in commercial technologies, as well as approaches that are documented in the literature, and/or developed by the academic building research community. We present a testing procedure and metrics to assess the performance of whole-building M\&amp;V methods. We then illustrate the test procedure by evaluating the accuracy of ten baseline energy use models, against measured data from a large dataset of 537 buildings. The results of this study show that the already available advanced interval data baseline models hold great promise for scaling the adoption of building measured savings calculations using Advanced Metering Infrastructure ({AMI}) data. Median coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error ({CV}({RMSE})) was less than 25\% for every model tested when twelve months of training data were used. With even six months of training data, median {CV}({RMSE}) for daily energy total was under 25\% for all models tested. These findings can be used to build confidence in model robustness, and the readiness of these approaches for industry uptake and adoption.},

To evaluate the predictions from a computer program, the program is provided with electric load data, and additional data such as outdoor air temperature, from a “training period” of at least several months duration, and used to predict the energy use as a function of time during the subsequent “prediction period.” The predicted energy use is compared to the actual energy use, and errors are summarized with several metrics, including bias and mean absolute percent error ({MAPE}). An important feature of this methodology is that it can be used to assess the predictive accuracy of a model even if the model itself is not provided to the evaluator, so that proprietary tools can be evaluated while protecting the developer's intellectual property. The methodology was applied to evaluate several standard statistical models using data from four hundred randomly selected commercial buildings in a large utility territory in Northern California; the result is a statistical distribution of errors for each of the models. We also demonstrate how the methodology can be used to assess the uncertainty in baseline energy predictions for a portfolio of buildings, which is an issue that is important for the design of utility programs that incentivize energy savings. The findings of this work can be used to (1) inform technology assessments for technologies that deliver operational and/or behavioral savings; and (2) determine the expected accuracy of statistical models used for automated measurement and verification (M\&amp;V) of energy savings.},

	abstract = {Retrofitting existing buildings is urgent given the increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of the existing building stock. This paper presents a scalable, probabilistic methodology that can support large scale investments in energy retrofit of buildings while accounting for uncertainty. The methodology is based on Bayesian calibration of normative energy models. Based on {CEN}-{ISO} standards, normative energy models are light-weight, quasi-steady state formulations of heat balance equations, which makes them appropriate for modeling large sets of buildings efficiently. Calibration of these models enables improved representation of the actual buildings and quantification of uncertainties associated with model parameters. In addition, the calibrated models can incorporate additional uncertainties coming from retrofit interventions to generate probabilistic predictions of retrofit performance. Probabilistic outputs can be straightforwardly translated to quantify risks of under-performance associated with retrofit interventions. A case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology with the use of normative models can correctly evaluate energy retrofit options and support risk conscious decision-making by explicitly inspecting risks associated with each retrofit option.},

The sampled buildings include 93 hotel buildings, 303 office buildings, 106 retail buildings, and 38 mixed developments. The analysis mainly used linear regression and paired sample t-test. The results showed that relative to 2019, the mean energy use intensity ({EUI}) of sampled commercial buildings decreased by 56.77 {kWh}/m² in the pandemic year (2020), a plunge of 19.9\%. The extent to which the {EUI} of each type of commercial building is affected by the pandemic is found as: mixed development{\textgreater}retail{\textgreater}office{\textgreater}hotel. The study also identified the factors that significantly influenced the {EUI} of commercial buildings before and during the pandemic. The results of the study complement existing knowledge about the factors influencing energy consumption in commercial buildings by considering the impact of the pandemic and furthermore contribute to the improvement of energy management in commercial buildings by providing directions for building energy efficiency approaches.},

For this purpose, weather-adjusted energy use was compared before and during the lockdown, including different levels of lockdown restrictions. Results obtained for the 83 academic buildings of Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - Barcelona Tech ({UPC}) reveal that the avoided energy consumption amounted to over 4.3 {GWh} during the post-pandemic year. However, the results indicate that academic buildings were still using approximately 46.9\% of their typical energy consumption during strict lockdown. This revelation emphasizes the high environmental burden of buildings, regardless of whether they are occupied.},

The University of Almeria campus also declined the energy consumption in 2020, and through this study, we aimed to measure the impact of closing the campus on the energy use of its different facilities. We built our analysis based upon the dataset collected during the year 2020 and previous years; the patterns evolution through time allowed us to better understand the energy performance of each facility during this exceptional year. We rearranged the university buildings into categories, and all the categories reduced their electricity consumption share in comparison with the previous year of 2019. Furthermore, the portfolio of categories presented a wide range of ratios that varied from 56\% to 98\%, the library category was found to be the most influenced, and the research category was found to be the least influenced. This opened questions like why some facilities were influenced more than others? What can we do to reduce the energy use even more when the facilities are closed? The university buildings presented diverse structures that revealed differences in energy performance, which explained why the impact of such an event ({COVID}-19 pandemic) is not necessarily relevant to have equivalent variations. Nevertheless, some management deficiencies were detected, and some energy savings measures were proposed to achieve a minimum waste of energy.},

This study represents the first known attempt to compare the carbon footprint of a mid-sized {UK} University produced during the {COVID}-19 lockdown (April–June 2020) against that generated within the respective time period in previous years. Although the overall carbon footprint of the University decreased by almost 30\% during the lockdown, the carbon intensity of online teaching and learning was found to be substantial and almost equal to that of staff and student commute in the pre-lockdown period. The study contributed to an emerging academic discourse on the carbon (dis)benefits of different models of higher education provision in the {UK} and beyond.

	abstract = {Although {COVID}-19 has significantly changed the higher educational sector, there are few studies revealing how this pandemic has changed the energy use of higher education buildings. This study was conducted not only to disclose the energy use change under {COVID}-19 but also to identify the corresponding facilities management strategies for future learning and teaching delivery modes under virtual campuses. This study collected the energy use data of 122 buildings across five campuses in Griffith University, located in Southeast Queensland, Australia, during the {COVID}-19 academic year (February 17, 2020, to February 21, 2021) and during a typical normal academic year (February 18, 2019, to February 16, 2020) by {PI} Vision Platform, and compared the data using the t-test and multiple linear regression. The results indicated that learning and administration activities became off campus during the pandemic, while research activities remained on campus. During the {COVID}-19 academic year, an amount of 9,646,933 {kWh} energy or around 24.88 {kWh}/m2 of energy use intensity was saved, which accounted for 16\% of the total energy use per academic year. Specifically, the shutting down of air conditioning in academic buildings, administration buildings, retail buildings and teaching buildings during {COVID}-19 saved 4,566 {kWh} (1.13 {kWh}/m2), 966 {kWh} (0.8 {kWh}/m2), 1,472 {kWh} (1.4 {kWh}/m2) and 860 {kWh} (1.3 {kWh}/m2) of electricity use per week, respectively, which accounted for 51.5\%, 44.3\%, 48.3\% and 57.1\% of total energy use per week during this period, respectively. Based on this analysis and the changing educational environment, this study also speculated on the energy implications of future teaching and learning practices, which provided guidance to the facilities management under virtual campuses.},

To study this shift, we survey full-time workers who finished primary school in twenty-seven countries as of mid-2021 and early 2022. Our cross-country comparisons control for age, gender, education, and industry and treat the United States mean as the baseline. We find, first, that {WFH} averages 1.5 days per week in our sample, ranging widely across countries. Second, employers plan an average of 0.7 {WFH} days per week after the pandemic, but workers want 1.7 days. Third, employees value the option to {WFH} two to three days per week at 5 percent of pay, on average, with higher valuations for women, people with children, and those with longer commutes. Fourth, most employees were favorably surprised by their {WFH} productivity during the pandemic. Fifth, looking across individuals, employer plans for {WFH} levels after the pandemic rise strongly with {WFH} productivity surprises during the pandemic. Sixth, looking across countries, planned {WFH} levels rise with the cumulative stringency of government-mandated lockdowns during the pandemic. We draw on these results to explain the big shift to {WFH} and to consider some implications for workers, organization, cities, and the pace of innovation.},

Leveraging the advances in machine learning and other supporting digital technologies, recent attempts have been sought to establish exciting smart building applications that facilitates better facility management and higher energy efficiency. However, relying on the historical data collected prior to the pandemic, the resulting smart building applications are not necessarily effective under the current ever-changing situation due to the drifts of data distribution. This paper investigates the bidirectional interaction between human and buildings that leads to dramatic change of building performance data distributions post-pandemic, and evaluates the applicability of typical facility management and energy management applications against these changes. According to the evaluation, this paper recommends three mitigation measures to rescue the applications and embedded machine learning algorithms from the data inconsistency issue in the post-pandemic era. Among these measures, incorporating occupancy and behavioural parameters as independent variables in machine learning algorithms is highlighted. Taking a Bayesian perspective, the value of data is exploited, historical or recent, pre- and post-pandemic, under a people-focused view.},

This study is to determine fan energy changes due to cleaning an {HVAC} system (filter, coils, and ducts) and/or applying {HEPA} filters (or other air cleaning devices). System energy use varies because the system pressure is reduced/increased resulting in the fan operating at a new point on the fan curve. Full scale laboratory experiments were conducted that confirmed and quantified the fan energy increase as a result of the system pressure increase. Results from both instantaneous experiment and short-term building load experiment suggest an energy increase between -5.1 to 45.5\% when including the effect of system pressure increase and duct leakage (or -5.1 to 10.8\% when only considering fouled filters and ducts). The findings with the system pressure increase and leakage are similar to the experimental results of Yang et. al. [7,8] that revealed -7 to 40\% energy increase. The lab results provide good benchmarks for verifying computer models focusing on the pressures in a {HVAC} system.},

Indoor particle removal technology with minimal pressure drop is urgently needed for both air purification and energy conservation. Electrostatic enhanced air filter ({EEAF}) has potential to achieve high filtration efficiency and low energy consumption simultaneously. It uses external electric field to improve fabric filter performance without adding pressure drop. However, available researches utilized {EEAF} with flat filter in laboratory-scale study, which restricted engineering applications due to limited filtration area and high pressure drop. In order to improve {EEAF}, the present study developed electrostatic enhanced pleated air filters ({EEPF}). Experiments and mathematical model established in our previous study were adopted to investigate filtration performance of {EEPF} for fine particles (0.01–10 μm). Compared to {EEAF} with flat filter, {EEPF} saved 75\% energy consumption and improved filtration efficiency up to 20\%. Results show that filtration efficiency of {EEPF} was sensitive to duct velocity, applied voltage and filter type. Ozone mass generated by {EEPF} satisfied {ASHRAE} standards. The validated mathematical model was adopted to optimize pleat geometries of {EEPF}. Compared with {HEPA}, optimal {EEPF} had comparable filtration efficiency ({\textgreater}98\%) and saved 70\% energy consumption.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To investigate the comparative efficacy of bevacizumab (Avastin) and ranibizumab (Lucentis; both Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, {CA}) for diabetic macular edema ({DME}) using a crossover study design.
Design
Randomized, double-masked, 36-week, 3-period crossover clinical trial.
Participants
Fifty-six subjects with {DME} involving the center of the macula in one or both eyes.
Methods
Monthly intravitreous injections of bevacizumab (1.25 mg) or ranibizumab (0.3 mg).
Main Outcome Measures
Comparison of mean changes in visual acuity and central retinal thickness, tested using a linear mixed-effects model.
Results
Based on the linear mixed-effects model, the 3-month estimated mean improvement in visual acuity was 5.3 letters for bevacizumab and 6.6 letters for ranibizumab (difference, 1.3 letters; P = 0.039). Estimated change in optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) central subfield mean thickness ({CSMT}) was −89 μm for bevacizumab and −137 μm for ranibizumab (difference, 48 μm; P {\textless} 0.001). Incorporating cumulative treatment benefit, the model yielded a predicted 36-week (9-month) average improvement in visual acuity of 7.1 letters (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 5.0–9.2) for bevacizumab and 8.4 letters (95\% {CI}, 6.3–10.5) for ranibizumab, and a change in {OCT} {CSMT} of −128 μm (95\% {CI}, −155 to −100) for bevacizumab and −176 μm (95\% {CI}, −202 to −149) for ranibizumab. There was no significant treatment-by-period interaction (i.e., treatment difference was constant in all 3 periods), nor was there a significant differential carryover effect from one period to the next.
Conclusions
This trial demonstrated a statistically significant but small relative clinical benefit of ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab for treatment of {DME}, using a markedly reduced sample size relative to a full comparative efficacy study. The effects on visual acuity and central retinal thickness for the 2 drugs are consistent with those reported at 1 year for the concurrent parallel-group trial by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network testing bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept for {DME}. The 3-period crossover design allowed for meaningful and efficient comparison, suggesting that this approach may be useful for future comparative efficacy studies of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor drugs for {DME}.},

	abstract = {Background 
          N-of-1 trials (multiple crossover studies conducted in single individuals) may be ideal for determining individual treatment effects and as a tool to estimate heterogeneity of treatment effects ({HTE}) in a population. However, comprehensive data on n-of-1 trial methodology and analysis is lacking. We performed this study to describe n-of-1 trial characteristics, examine treatment changes resulting from n-of-1 trial participation, and to determine if trial reporting is adequate for estimating {HTE}.
          Methods 
          We undertook a systematic review of n-of-1 trials published between 1985 and December 2010. Included trials were those having individual treatment episodes as the unit of randomization and reporting individual-specific treatment effects. We abstracted trial characteristics, treatment change information, and analytic methods.
          Results 
          We included 108 trials reporting on 2154 participants. Approximately half (49\%) of the trials used a statistical cutoff to determine a superior treatment, whereas the remainder used a graphical comparison (25\%) or a clinical significance cutoff (20\%). Sixty-seven trials, reporting on 488 people, provided treatment change information: 54\% of participants had subsequent treatment decisions consistent with the results of the trial, 8\% had decisions inconsistent with trial results, and 38\% had ambiguous results. Less than half of the trials (45\%) reported adequate information to facilitate the calculation of {HTE}.
          Conclusion 
          N-of-1 trials are a useful tool for enhancing therapeutic precision in a range of conditions and should be conducted more often. To facilitate future meta-analysis, and the estimation of {HTE}, researchers reporting n-of-1 trial results should clearly describe individual data.},

We primarily focus on demand response. Methods discussed include graphical representations of electric load data, a regression-based electricity load model that uses a time-of-week indicator variable and a piecewise linear and continuous outdoor air temperature dependence and the definition of various parameters that characterize facility electricity loads and demand response behavior. In the future, these methods could be translated into easy-to-use tools for building managers.},

	abstract = {Optimal operation of chillers could be realized by controlling chiller on–off status and resetting chilled water supply/return temperature. The chilled water supply temperature could influence both chiller power and indoor comfort simultaneously. Hence, it is necessary to optimize its set point. By combining the reinforcement learning ({RL}) technique and expertise knowledge, a hybrid model-free chilled water temperature resetting method for chillers is proposed, to improve the robustness and learning speed of {RL} control. The proposed method and the comparative expert manual control are applied to control an actual {HVAC} system in Shanghai. Engineering practice results suggest: (1) the energy-saving performance of the hybrid model-free method is close to that of expert manual control, with limited comfort sacrifice, acceptable robustness, learning speed and control stability; (2) without model establishing and persistent manual overwatch work, the proposed control method could conserve manual labor before and after the intervention of optimized control. Based on the engineering practice, a supplementary simulation study is conducted, which indicates: (1) the performance of the proposed method only takes one cooling season to converge; (2) the proposed hybrid method outperforms both pure {RL}-based control and pure rule-based control in the first training cooling season, while inferior to model predictive control; (3) the proposed method is an acceptable alternative for systems without sufficient data or certain equipment condition, due to its online self-learning mechanism and low pre-condition requirement on historical data and models.},

However, broad assessment of {DRL}-based building control is still required to characterize their pros and cons in comparison with conventional rule-based feedback controls. In this paper, we assessed {DRL}-based controls with on-policy learning-based algorithms and continuous control actions for cooling control of large office buildings in the summer season to minimize whole-building energy use and occupant discomfort. We compared {DRL}-based control methods with two baseline control methods: (1) a pre-determined schedule with supply temperature and static pressure setpoints, and (2) advanced reset method that adjusts setpoints based on heuristic rules, i.e., {ASHRAE} Guideline 36. We also tested the {DRL} algorithms to evaluate their performances in multiple climate locations. We found that {DRL}-based control methods outperformed the baseline control methods in terms of energy savings while maintaining a thermal comfort. {DRL} reduced energy use between ∼4\%–22\% on average compared to the baseline methods, depending on climate location. We also evaluated {DRL}-based control in terms of control stability and showed that {DRL}-based methods should consider hardware lifetimes in practical operations.},

	abstract = {Although the energy and cost benefits for retrofitting existing buildings are promising, several challenges remain for accurate measurement and verification (M\&V) analysis to estimate these benefits. Due to the rapid development in advanced metering infrastructure ({AMI}), data-driven approaches are becoming more effective than deterministic methods in developing baseline energy models for existing buildings using historical energy consumption data. The literature review presented in this paper provides an extensive summary of data-driven approaches suitable for building energy consumption prediction needed for M\&V applications. The presented literature review describes commonly used data-driven modeling approaches including linear regressions, decision trees, ensemble methods, support vector machine, deep learning, and kernel regressions. The advantages and limitations of each data-driven modeling approach and its variants are discussed, including their cited applications. Additionally, feature engineering methods used in building energy data-driven modeling are outlined and described based on reported case studies to outline commonly used building features as well as selection and processing techniques of the most relevant features. This review highlights the gap between the listed existing frameworks and recently reported case studies using data-driven models. As a conclusion, this review demonstrates the need for a flexible M\&V analysis framework to identify the best data-driven methods and their associated features depending on the building type and retrofit measures.},

We present a Monte Carlo expectation maximization ({MCEM}) framework for constructing baseline Gaussian process ({GP}) models under uncertain input data. We demonstrate that the {GP}-{MCEM} framework yields more robust predictions and confidence levels compared with standard {GP} training approaches that neglect uncertainty. We argue that the approach can also reduce data needs because it implicitly expands the data range used for training and can thus be used as a mechanism to reduce data collection and sensor installation costs in M\&V processes. We analyze the numerical behavior of the framework and conclude that robust predictions can be obtained with relatively few samples.},

	abstract = {Implementing energy conservation measures in buildings can reduce energy costs and environmental impacts, but such measures cost money to implement so intelligent investment strategies require the ability to quantify the energy savings by comparing actual energy used to how much energy would have been used in absence of the conservation measures (known as the “baseline” energy use). Methods exist for predicting baseline energy use, but a limitation of most statistical methods reported in the literature is inadequate quantification of the uncertainty in baseline energy use predictions. However, estimation of uncertainty is essential for weighing the risks of investing in retrofits. Most commercial buildings have, or soon will have, electricity meters capable of providing data at short time intervals. These data provide new opportunities to quantify uncertainty in baseline predictions, and to do so after shorter measurement durations than are traditionally used. In this paper, we show that uncertainty estimation provides greater measurement and verification (M\&V) information and helps to overcome some of the difficulties with deciding how much data is needed to develop baseline models and to confirm energy savings. We also show that cross-validation is an effective method for computing uncertainty. In so doing, we extend a simple regression-based method of predicting energy use using short-interval meter data. We demonstrate the methods by predicting energy use in 17 real commercial buildings. We discuss the benefits of uncertainty estimates which can provide actionable decision making information for investing in energy conservation measures.},
